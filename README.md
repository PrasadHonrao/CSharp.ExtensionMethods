# CSharp.ExtensionMethods

Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. **CSharp.ExtensionMethods** is a set of such commonly used C# extension methods.

## Quickstart
The latest release of the CSharp.ExtensionMethods is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSharp.ExtensionMethods/0.0.1-alpha)
